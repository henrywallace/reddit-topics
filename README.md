# Reddit Topic Modeling

*This is a work in progress*. Henry and Lukas are collaborating to discover how topics in Reddit threads most often flow. Several subreddits will be scraped, and tokenized. Then, topics will be found via [LDA](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~blei/papers/BleiNgJordan2003.pdf). Finally, calculate first order transitions between topics over all parent-child comment pairs. These transitions can be visualized with a state graph.
